## 📊 Project Overview

This project simulates one year of point-of-sale activity (**2025-06-01 → 2026-05-30**) for a fragrance house operating across three international airports. It demonstrates the complete analytics workflow:

**Data modeling → synthetic data generation (Python) → Google Sheets source → Looker Studio dashboard → insight storytelling.**

The dataset is intentionally engineered with real-world commercial patterns — seasonality, gifting peaks, an event-driven demand spike, and region/airport personality — so the dashboard surfaces genuine business stories rather than random noise.

> ⚠️ **All data is 100% synthetic.** No real customer, sales, or proprietary company data is used. The dataset was generated programmatically for demonstration purposes.

## ✨ Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard turns ~16,000 transactions into an explorable commercial story. Key views include:

- **KPI scorecards** — total revenue, transactions, average transaction value (ATV), and units sold.
- **Revenue over time** — monthly trend revealing the summer peak and December gifting spike.
- **Collection mix** — Perfume vs. Body Care vs. Candle contribution to revenue and volume.
- **Top performers** — best-selling fragrances and products (Pareto / top-N).
- **Airport & terminal breakdown** — performance by hub (MAD / CDG / DXB) and terminal.
- **Customer dimensions** — sales split by traveler **region** (APAC / AMER / EAMA / EUEA) and **gender**.
- **Staff performance** — revenue and transactions per sales associate.
- **Interactive filters** — slice the entire report by date range, airport, collection, region, and more.

## 🗂️ Dataset

One row = one point-of-sale transaction line. **14 analytical columns** (+ a transaction key).

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `transaction_id` | Unique row key |
| `date` / `month` | Sale date and year-month |
| `collection` | Perfume / Body Care / Candle |
| `product` | Item form (e.g. "Eau de Parfum", "Body Lotion") |
| `fragrance` | Scent (20 perfume scents; signature scent per body-care/candle item) |
| `size` | Volume — perfume 100/50/30 ml; body-care & candle fixed per item |
| `volume_units` | Quantity sold |
| `unit_price` / `total_price` | EUR; `total = unit_price × volume_units` |
| `traveler_gender` | F / M |
| `region` | APAC / AMER / EAMA / EUEA |

## 🚀 Reproduce the Dataset

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/travel-retail-perfumery-dashboard.git
cd travel-retail-perfumery-dashboard

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy

# 3. Generate the dataset
python scripts/generate_dataset.py
```

The generator uses a **fixed random seed (`42`)**, so every run reproduces the exact same dataset. To feed Looker Studio, upload the resulting CSV to Google Sheets and connect it as a data source.

## 🧪 Data Generation Methodology

The dataset is not random — it encodes deliberate commercial logic so analysis yields meaningful findings:

- **Seasonality:** monthly demand multipliers model a summer peak (Jul–Aug) and a December gifting peak; a post-holiday dip follows in January.
- **Event modeling:** a Chinese New Year window (5–22 Feb 2026) boosts DXB volume by 25% and shifts the traveler mix toward APAC.
- **Airport profiles:** each hub has its own base traffic level and region distribution (DXB APAC-heavy; MAD/CDG Europe-heavy).
- **Pricing:** a fixed price book with standard vs. premium perfume tiers; `total_price` is always internally consistent.
- **Behavioral nuance:** weekend uplift, gift-season quantity increases, and collection-specific gender skews.
